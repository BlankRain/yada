;; This is kind of like a bidi route structure

;; But we shouldn't limit ourselves to only that which is declared, because so much more can be generated, like 404s, etc.

;; There should be a general handler that does the right thing
;; wrt. available methods (Method Not Allowed) and calls out to
;; callbacks accordingly. Perhaps there's no sense in EVERYTHING being
;; overridable, as with Liberator. It should hard-code the things that
;; don't make sense to override, and use hooks for the rest.

;; Resource existence is most important - and not covered by swagger, so it's a key hook.

;; Return deferreds, if necessary, if the computation is length to compute (e.g. for exists? checks)

;; CORS support: build this in, make allow-origin first-class, which headers should be allowed should be a hook (with default)
