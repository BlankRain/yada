;; Resource existence is most important - and not covered by swagger, so it's a key hook.

;; Return deferreds, if necessary, if the computation is length to compute (e.g. for exists? checks)

;; CORS support: build this in, make allow-origin first-class, which headers should be allowed should be a hook (with default)
