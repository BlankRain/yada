;; Ring's multipart-params middleware wraps Apache's commons file-upload
;; library which expects a single input-stream for multipart/* content.

;; yada's approach is different. Firstly, it uses manifold streams which
;; return java.nio.ByteBuffer buffers. This allows asynchronous reads
;; which avoids the thread-per-request limitation of both Ring and
;; commons file-upload.

;; Secondly, we use a faster algorithm (Boyer-Moore, 1977) for finding
;; boundaries in the content in order separate the parts. This algorithm
;; has the useful property of being able to hop through the byte-buffer,
;; rather than comparing each byte in turn.

;; Rather than use a stream-based approach, which slightly diminishes
;; performance, we apply this algorithm to the each byte buffer in
;; turn. If a given buffer does not end in a boundary, we store the
;; partial data until a boundary is found in a subsequent buffer.

  "Asynchronously parse a multipart stream arriving in chunks from the
  given source. Returns a stream emitting pieces which can be assembled
  to form parts of a multipart stream.

  The parts in the multipart should be separated with boundaries, as
  required by RFC 2046. The boundary string is given as an argument.

  Every piece is a map which is labelled with a :type entry. Small
  pieces that form whole parts are labelled with a :type value of :part.

  Larger parts are broken into a sequence of pieces. The first piece is
  labelled :partial, subsequence pieces are
  labelled :partial-continuation except the last one which is
  labelled :partial-completion.

  If there is a preamble in the multipart, this is indicated by a piece
  labelled :preamble. Similar to the handling of large parts, a large
  preamble is broken into pieces
  labelled :partial-preamble, :preamble-continuation
  and :preamble-completion. Consumers should be aware of this in order
  to properly discard a preamble that spans multiple chunks.

  If the multipart content is properly terminated with a correct
  end-marker, the stream is terminated with a piece labelled with :end
  which also contains the epilogue, if any. Typically the epilogue is
  discarded.

  The window-size argument indicates the size of the buffer that will be
  used to analyze incoming chunks. It should ideally be a multiple of
  the maximum expected chunk size, specifically it should be at least
  the size of the maximum expected chunk size (request buffer size) plus
  twice the length of the delimiter (the delimiter is derived from the
