;; Ring's multipart-params middleware wraps Apache's commons file-upload
;; library which expects a single input-stream for multipart/* content.

;; yada's approach is different. Firstly, it uses manifold streams which
;; return java.nio.ByteBuffer buffers. This allows asynchronous reads
;; which avoids the thread-per-request limitation of both Ring and
;; commons file-upload.

;; Secondly, we use a faster algorithm (Boyer-Moore, 1977) for finding
;; boundaries in the content in order separate the parts. This algorithm
;; has the useful property of being able to hop through the byte-buffer,
;; rather than comparing each byte in turn.

;; Rather than use a stream-based approach, which slightly diminishes
;; performance, we apply this algorithm to the each byte buffer in
;; turn. If a given buffer does not end in a boundary, we store the
;; partial data until a boundary is found in a subsequent buffer.
