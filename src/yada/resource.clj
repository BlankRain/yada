Anything you return from this function will be available in the :resource entry of ctx and will form the type that will be used to dispatch other functions in this protocol. You can return a deferred if necessary (indeed, you should do so if you have to perform some IO in this function). Often, you will return 'this', perhaps augmented with some additional state. Sometimes you will return something else.")
