  resource properties such as a new version (for determining the final
  ETag on the response. Any value in the map returned can be deferred,

  of'. Drives the default negotiation algorithm."))

;; One idea is to combine 'static' representations with 'dynamic'
;; ones. Swagger can use the static representations, but these can be
;; augmented by content-specific ones. DirectoryResource, for example,
;; would be able to provide some static representations to explain to
;; swagger that it could be posted to with particular content, but would
;; change these on a request containing a path-info. The dynamic version
;; would have access to the static result, via the context, and could
;; choose how to augment these (override completely, concat, etc.)
