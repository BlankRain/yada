Suppose the __resource map__ contains a constant __:body__ value of "Hello World!".

<resource-map/>

We can test the effect of this by running the example with the 'Try it' button. (This sends a request from your browser to a web application which uses yada to handle the request.)

<response/>

The status is set to 200 (OK) and the response body is "Hello World!".
