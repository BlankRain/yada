Parameters are an important part of many requests and since APIs form
the basis of integration between software, it is useful to be able to
declare parameter expectations.

These expectations form the basis of a contract between a user-agent and
server. If a user-agent does not meet the contract set by the API, the
server can respond with a 400 status code, indicating that the request
is malformed.
