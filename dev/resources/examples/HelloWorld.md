Suppose the __resource map__ contains a constant __:body__ value of "Hello World!".

<resource-map/>

We can test the effect of this by running the example with the 'Try it' button below. This sends the following request from your browser to a web application.

<request/>

The request is routed to a yada handler which is configured with the resource map above, which generates the response which is displayed below :-

<response/>

The status is set to 200 (OK) and the response body is "Hello World!".
