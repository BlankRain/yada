yada is currently being developed and in alpha release, subject to change. Until a roughly comprehensive coverage of HTTP is achieved, the design of any single feature may change. Please take this into account if you are going to adopt yada prior to an official beta release.

yada is developed according to a method called _Documentation Driven Development_, where documentation for a given feature is written
immediately prior to feature implementation. This ensures that features
are explained fully prior to their implementation, which helps to
justify their inclusion.

The documentation includes many examples, which are all executable, offering the
benefits of a test suite.
