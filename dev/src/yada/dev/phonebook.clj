;; Create a simple HTTP service to represent a phone book.

;; Acceptance criteria.
;; - List all entries in the phone book.
;; - Create a new entry to the phone book.
;; - Remove an existing entry in the phone book.
;; - Update an existing entry in the phone book.
;; - Search for entries in the phone book by surname.

;; A phone book entry must contain the following details:
;; - Surname
;; - Firstname
;; - Phone number
;; - Address (optional)

;; The solution can be in any language. Please upload your project to github and provide us with the URL.
;; We are not looking for a client or UI for this solution, a simple HTTP based service will suffice.
