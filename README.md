# yada

yada is a web library for Clojure. It is a sibling library to [bidi](http://github.com/juxt/bidi) - whereas bidi is based on _routes as data_, yada is based on _resources as data_.

yada takes data declarations and produces a sophisticated Ring
handler.

It has the following features

* Comprehensive HTTP coverage
* Parameter coercion, automatic Swagger support
* Asynch foundation based on [manifold](https://github.com/ztellman/manifold)
* Protocol extensibility

Full documentation for 0.4.3 is available at
[http://yada.juxt.pro](http://yada.juxt.pro) or offline (see below).

Incomplete documentation for 1.0.x is available [here](dev/resources/user-manual.md).

## Installation

For the latest stable release, add the following dependency to your
`project.clj` file

```clojure
[yada "0.4.3"]
```

For the latest release, use the following

```clojure
[yada "1.0.0-20150803.074120-1"]
```

## Status

Please note that being a 0.x.y version indicates the provisional status
of this library, and that features are subject to change.

For the latest 1.0.x release there are expected to be some bugs. Please
feel free to raise GitHub issues.
