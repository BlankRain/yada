# Installation

yada is a Clojure library and if you are using it directly from a
Clojure application with a Leiningen `project.clj` file, include the
following in the file's __:dependencies__ section.

```clojure
[yada "1.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]

[aleph "0.4.1-beta3"]
[bidi "2.0.0"]
```

If you want to use yada to create a web API, this is all you need to
do. But you can also clone the yada repository with `git`.

```nohighlight
git clone https://github.com/juxt/yada
```
